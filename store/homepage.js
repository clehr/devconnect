      `Our idea of a growing and diverse community is already 5 years old and
      finally it takes a concrete form!`,

      `Especially as a beginner it's hard to find his/her own way into the IT
      world as there is so much to explore.`,

      `Should I become a backend or a frontend developer? Which language do I
      chose? Java, Javascript or maybe better Ruby? Where to start? `,

      `Also many struggle if they are even suited to become developer especially
      when they have reached a certain age. Often the thought is: "I'm too old
      to become a programmer". `,

      `The message of DevConnect is quite clear: "No, you are not! And yes, you
      can become a developer too."`,

      `As in our opinion everyone has the potential to learn new things we want
      to empower that.`,
      `And what is the best way to do that? By having a caring and supportive
      community and mentors that will guide you through the process of getting
      more experience and getting to know a lot of people that are beginners
      like you. `,
